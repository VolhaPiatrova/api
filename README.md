# API Testing  
1. In accordance with the Swagger documentation at https://qa.demoshopping.ru/api-docs/, I created a collection for the "Online Store" project at https://demoshopping.ru/. All methods have been documented in Postman, and environment variables that are frequently reused — such as the base URL and token — have been created.

      1.1. The collection I created in JSON format
